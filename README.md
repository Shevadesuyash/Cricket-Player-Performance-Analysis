# 🏏 Cricket Player Performance Analysis

This project analyzes cricket player performance using data-driven insights and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand key performance metrics of players and predict future performance using statistical and ML models.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Cricket Player Performance Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akarshsinghh/cricket-player-performance-prediction)
- **Contents**: The dataset contains match-wise performance data of cricket players including:
  - Runs scored
  - Balls faced
  - Fours and sixes
  - Strike rate
  - Opponent team
  - Venue
  - Player name, etc.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Colab Notebook**

## 📌 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual insights into player statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Performance classification using ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Accuracy and model evaluation using confusion matrix

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

The following classification models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Each model was tested using player statistics to predict whether a player will perform well (based on defined thresholds).

## 🔍 Results

- Random Forest performed the best among the models with higher accuracy.
- Strike rate, venue, and opponent were found to be key influencing features in performance.
